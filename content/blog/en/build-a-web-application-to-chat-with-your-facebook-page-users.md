## Introduction

The [Messages API](https://developer.nexmo.com/messages/overview) is being integrated into the [Client SDK](https://developer.nexmo.com/client-sdk/overview). This will provide a straightforward method where your customers, via Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, and more, can communicate with an application you create.

By the end of this blog post, you’ll have a web application capable of sending and receiving messages from your Facebook page and your page’s Messenger. Sample code will be provided and the relevant parts to the Messages API integration will be explained.

## Create a Facebook page

Log into Facebook and [create a Test Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/creation/) unless you want to test with a page already created. 

## Set up the sample web application

Make your own copy of the sample web application by \[remixing this Glitch](link to remix Glitch project).  To get your application set up, follow the steps in the readme file. The sample application follows the scenario of an agent signing into a dashboard where a list of current conversations with Facebook page customers that the agent is a part of. On the left side is where all the conversations are happening and the agent can join one.

When the agent clicks a conversation, a chat application with the Facebook User will open in a new window. The chat application is based on the one created in the [Creating a chat app tutorial](https://developer.nexmo.com/client-sdk/tutorials/in-app-messaging).

## Link your Facebook page to your Vonage application

All that is left of the setup is to connect your Facebook page to the web application so they can communicate back and forth. Here are the steps:

* Log into the [Vonage Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com)
* Under “Messages and Dispatch” click “Social channels”

![Screen shot of Messages and Dispatch menu with submenu of Sandbox and Social channels](/content/blog/build-a-web-application-to-chat-with-your-facebook-page-users/01-messages-and-dispatch-menu.png "Vonage Dashboard Messages and Dispatch menu")

* On the “Social channels” page, click Facebook Messenger

* Follow the steps to connect your Facebook page to your Vonage Account

![Screen shot of steps to connect a Facebook Page](/content/blog/build-a-web-application-to-chat-with-your-facebook-page-users/03-connect-facebook-page-masked.png "Connect Facebook Page")

* Select the Facebook page(s) to connect to Vonage 

![Screen shot of a Facebook Page selector](/content/blog/build-a-web-application-to-chat-with-your-facebook-page-users/03-connect-facebook-page-2.png "Select a Facebook Page")

* Verify you are using the correct Facebook account

![Screen shot of a confirmation popup to continue as a user](/content/blog/build-a-web-application-to-chat-with-your-facebook-page-users/03-connect-facebook-page-3.png "Continue as user")

* Review the permissions granted to Vonage

![Screen shot of the list of permissions that can be granted to Vonage](/content/blog/build-a-web-application-to-chat-with-your-facebook-page-users/03-connect-facebook-page-4.png "Ask for permissions")

* Confirmation that Vonage was able to be successfully linked

![Confirmation of Facebook Page being successfully linked](/content/blog/build-a-web-application-to-chat-with-your-facebook-page-users/03-connect-facebook-page-5.png "Confirmation of Facebook Page being successfully linked")

* Select a Facebook page that was linked to Vonage and complete the setup

![Screen shot of Connect Facebook Page where the page can be selected.](/content/blog/build-a-web-application-to-chat-with-your-facebook-page-users/03-connect-facebook-page-6.png "Select your Facebook Business Page")

* Congratulations, your Facebook page was successfully connected

* Now that Vonage knows about your Facebook page, let’s connect to your Vonage application that was created when you set up the sample with Glitch. Either click “Link to an application” or go to the Applications section of the dashboard.

* Select the application you created when setting up the Glitch sample and then click “Link”.

## Try it out

Place the web application in one browser window and your Facebook page in another. If you haven’t already, enter a name in the web application to enter the dashboard. Think of this as your name or an agent’s name, it’s just a simple way to “log in”. Now, send a message to the Facebook page. A little card should pop up in the all conversations section of the web application. Click join and a chat application will open up and you should see the message in the chat. Send a message from the web application and it should appear in your Facebook Messenger.

## What’s Happening

Let’s take a look at the code involved to make the above happen.
When a user sends a message to your Facebook page, it gets sent by Vonage to your web application’s inbound webhook. The webhook returns an object that lets Vonage know how to handle the message. In this case, we are sending back information the Client SDK Messages API Integration needs to connect the Facebook User with your web application to have a conversation. This includes the Facebook User’s id and the conversation name (which we set as the Facebook User’s id so that it’s unique).

```javascript
// server.js
app.post("/webhooks/inbound", (request, response) => {
  response.status(200).send([{ "action": "message", "conversation_name": request.body.from.id, "user": request.body.from.id, "geo": "region-code" }]);
});
```

If this is the first time the Facebook User is sending a message, a new conversation is created. This emits a `conversation:created` event that we listen for on the events webhook. The web application’s backend takes this event and repackages it as a custom event, `custom:new_conv`, that can be used to notify the agent’s dashboard to display the new conversation. 

```javascript
// server.js
app.post("/webhooks/rtcevent", (request, response) => {
   ...
  // If Facebook user is new, a new conversation should be created, so listen for it here 
  // and then send the custom event to the Agents Conversation
  if (request.body.type === "conversation:created"){
    vonage.conversations.events.create(process.env.AGENTS_CONV_ID, {
      "type": "custom:new_conv",
      "from": "system",
      "body": request.body
    },
    (error, result) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(error);
      } else {
        console.log(result);
      }
    });
  }
  response.status(200).send({code:200, status: 'got rtcevent request'});
});

```

In the code for the chat application, there is a `message:received` event listener that fires when a message is received from the Facebook User. It then takes the message and adds it to the chat display.

```javascript
// public/chat.js
   // Adding conversation.id here in the on. means that we're filtering events to only the ones regarding this conversation. (it's called grouping)
    conversation.on('message:received', conversation.id, (from, event) => {
      console.log('message-received sender: ', from);
      console.log('message-reveived event: ', event);
      const formattedMessage = formatMessage(from, event, conversation.me);
      // Update UI
      messageFeed.innerHTML = messageFeed.innerHTML + formattedMessage;
      messagesCountSpan.textContent = messagesCount;
    });
```

When the agent responds to the Facebook User, that is an outbound message. Full implementation of outbound messages into the Client SDK will be completed in a future release. Until then, just like listening for when a new conversation is created, we can listen for when a `custom:chat` event is sent to the events webhook. The Vonage Node SDK is used to relay the agent’s message to the Facebook User.

```javascript
// server.js
app.post("/webhooks/rtcevent", (request, response) => {
  ...
  // We currently do not support the outbound part of the integration so you should take
  // the text message from the chat and relay to Messenger using the messages API 
  // (here, using the Server SDK wrapping of it)
  if (request.body.type === "custom:chat"){
    const FB_RECIPIENT_ID = request.body.from;
    const FB_SENDER_ID = request.body.to;
    vonage.channel.send(
      { type: 'messenger', id: FB_RECIPIENT_ID },
      { type: 'messenger', id: FB_SENDER_ID },
      {
          content: {
              type: 'text',
              text: request.body.text,
          },
      },
      (err, data) => {
          if (err) {
              console.error(err);
          } else {
              console.log(data.message_uuid);
          }
      }
    );
  }
  ...
});

```

## Conclusion

That’s it! With the Messages API integrated into the Client SDK, it is a lot easier to be able to communicate with a Facebook User from your own web application.
